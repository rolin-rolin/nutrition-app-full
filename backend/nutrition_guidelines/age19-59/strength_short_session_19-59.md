# Guidelines for Strength, Short Duration (20–30 min), Age 19–59

## Overall Macro Targets for Entire Session

-   **Total Carbs:** 0.5–0.7 g/kg
-   **Total Protein:** 0.25–0.3 g/kg (mostly post-exercise)
-   **Total Fat:** 0.1–0.2 g/kg
-   **Electrolytes:** Not critical unless heavy sweating
-   **Fluids:** 5–7 mL/kg pre/post

## Breakdown by Timing

### Pre-workout (30–60 min before)

-   **Carbs:** 0.4–0.5 g/kg (toast, fruit, granola)
-   **Protein:** Optional 0.05–0.1 g/kg
-   **Fluids:** 5 mL/kg

### During workout

-   **Carbs/Protein:** Not needed for short sessions
-   **Hydration:** Water as needed

### Post-workout (within 30 min)

-   **Carbs:** 0.5–0.7 g/kg
-   **Protein:** 0.25–0.3 g/kg
-   **Fluids:** 400–600 mL

## Key Principles

-   Post-workout protein supports muscle repair and growth.
-   Simple carb + protein snack is adequate.
