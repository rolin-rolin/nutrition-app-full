# Guidelines for Strength, Long Duration (45+ min), Age 6–11

## Overall Macro Targets for Entire Session

-   **Total Carbs:** 0.8–1.0 g/kg
-   **Total Protein:** 0.25–0.3 g/kg (mostly post-workout)
-   **Total Fat:** ~0.2 g/kg (mostly post-exercise)
-   **Electrolytes:**
    -   Sodium: 10–15 mg/kg if sweating
    -   Potassium: 1 mg/kg (optional)
-   **Fluids:** ~5–10 mL/kg across session

## Breakdown by Timing

### Pre-workout (30–60 min before)

-   **Carbs:** 0.5–0.8 g/kg (e.g., toast with honey, fruit smoothie)
-   **Protein:** ~0.1 g/kg (e.g., Greek yogurt, milk)
-   **Fluids:** 5 mL/kg

### During workout

-   **Carbs:** ~0.3–0.5 g/kg/hour (only if very intense or >60 min; try diluted juice or fruit snack)
-   **Protein:** Not needed during
-   **Hydration:** 150–200 mL water every 15–20 min

### Post-workout (within 30 min)

-   **Carbs:** 0.5–0.8 g/kg (e.g., rice, smoothie, banana)
-   **Protein:** 0.2–0.25 g/kg (e.g., milk, eggs, cheese, beans)
-   **Fat:** Optional (~0.1 g/kg; peanut butter, avocado)
-   **Fluids:** ~1.25x weight lost, or 400–600 mL

## Key Principles

-   Post-workout carb + protein combo supports growth and recovery.
-   Use real food, and match intake to appetite.
-   Encourage hydration as part of the routine, not as a chore.

## Avoid

-   Excessive protein (not needed in children)
-   Sports supplements
-   Meals too close to activity
