# Guidelines for Cardio, Short Duration (20–30 min), Age 19–59

## Overall Macro Targets for Entire Session

-   **Total Carbs:** 0.5–0.7 g/kg
-   **Total Protein:** 0.1–0.2 g/kg (optional, mostly post-exercise)
-   **Total Fat:** Minimal (<0.1 g/kg)
-   **Electrolytes:** Sodium ~15–25 mg/kg if sweating
-   **Fluids:** 5–7 mL/kg pre/post

## Breakdown by Timing

### Pre-workout (30–60 min before)

-   **Carbs:** 0.3–0.5 g/kg (e.g., fruit, toast, sports drink)
-   **Protein:** Optional, 0.05–0.1 g/kg
-   **Fluids:** 5 mL/kg 1–2 hrs before

### During workout

-   **Carbs/Protein:** Usually not needed for short cardio
-   **Hydration:** Water as needed

### Post-workout (within 30 min)

-   **Carbs:** 0.5–0.7 g/kg
-   **Protein:** 0.15–0.2 g/kg
-   **Fluids:** 300–600 mL water or electrolyte beverage

## Key Principles

-   Short cardio rarely demands structured nutrition but light carbs post-workout help recovery.
-   Hydration should be maintained especially if sweating.

## Avoid

-   High-fat or fiber foods pre-exercise
-   Energy drinks or excess caffeine
