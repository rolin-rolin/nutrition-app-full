# Guidelines for Cardio, Long Duration (90+ min), Age 19–59

## Overall Macro Targets for Entire Session

-   **Total Carbs:** 1.0–1.2 g/kg/hour
-   **Total Protein:** 0.3–0.4 g/kg
-   **Total Fat:** ~0.2–0.3 g/kg (minimal fat during activity)
-   **Total Electrolytes:**
    -   Sodium: 30–50 mg/kg/hour
    -   Potassium: 1–2 mg/kg/hour
    -   Magnesium: ~0.5 mg/kg/hour (optional, for heavy sweaters or heat)
-   **Total Fluids:** ~5–10 mL/kg every 15–20 min

## Breakdown by Timing

### Pre-workout (30–60 min before)

-   **Carbs:** ~0.5–1.0 g/kg (e.g., banana, low-fiber toast, sports drink)
-   **Protein:** ~0.1–0.2 g/kg (e.g., Greek yogurt, whey shake)
-   **Fat:** ~0.1 g/kg (minimize to avoid GI discomfort)
-   **Fluids:** ~5–7 mL/kg at least 4 hrs prior; +3–5 mL/kg if still dehydrated 2 hrs prior

### During workout

-   **Carbs:** 0.8–1.2 g/kg/hour (gels, sports drinks, fruit)
-   **Protein:** ~0.1–0.2 g/kg/hour (only for endurance >90 min)
-   **Electrolytes:**
    -   Sodium: 30–50 mg/kg/hour
    -   Potassium: 1–2 mg/kg/hour
-   **Hydration:** 150–250 mL every 15–20 min, based on sweat rate

### Post-workout (within 30 min)

-   **Carbs:** 1.0–1.2 g/kg (to replenish glycogen stores)
-   **Protein:** 0.25–0.4 g/kg (stimulates muscle repair & recovery)
-   **Fat:** ~0.1–0.2 g/kg (healthy fats OK in balanced meal)
-   **Fluids:** ~1.25–1.5 L per kg body weight lost

## Key Principles

-   **Carbohydrates:** Use fast-digesting forms during and after (e.g., glucose, maltodextrin).
-   **Protein:** Essential post-exercise for recovery; optional during prolonged sessions.
-   **Hydration:** Match sweat loss with fluid intake; monitor urine color.
-   **Electrolytes:** Prioritize sodium, especially in hot/humid conditions or heavy sweaters.
-   **Recovery:** Aim to eat within 30 minutes, followed by a full meal within 2 hours.

## Avoid During Long Cardio Sessions

-   High-fiber foods (can cause bloating or GI distress)
-   High-fat meals (slow gastric emptying)
-   Large solid meals close to or during exercise
-   Excess caffeine (especially if dehydrated or heat-stressed)
