# Guidelines for Strength, Short Duration (20–30 min), Age 12–18

## Overall Macro Targets for Entire Session

-   **Total Carbs:** 0.5–0.7 g/kg
-   **Total Protein:** 0.2–0.25 g/kg (most of it post-workout)
-   **Total Fat:** ~0.1–0.2 g/kg (mostly in post-workout meal/snack)
-   **Electrolytes:** Not critical unless in heat
-   **Fluids:** ~5–7 mL/kg pre/post

## Breakdown by Timing

### Pre-workout (30–60 min before)

-   **Carbs:** ~0.4–0.5 g/kg (e.g., toast, apple, granola)
-   **Protein:** Optional, ~0.05–0.1 g/kg (e.g., milk, cheese stick)
-   **Fluids:** 5 mL/kg ~1 hour prior

### During workout

-   **Carbs/Protein:** Not needed for <30 min sessions
-   **Hydration:** Water (~100–200 mL every 20 minutes if needed)

### Post-workout (within 30 min)

-   **Carbs:** 0.5–0.7 g/kg (e.g., fruit, rice cakes, granola bar)
-   **Protein:** 0.2–0.25 g/kg (e.g., chocolate milk, eggs, yogurt, lean meat)
-   **Fluids:** ~400–600 mL water or milk

## Key Principles

-   Post-strength protein is key to support muscle repair and growth during adolescence.
-   A simple carb + protein snack is typically enough after short lifting sessions.
-   Most adolescents meet their needs through food, but recovery snacks help consistency and progress.

## Avoid

-   Protein powders unless advised by a pediatric sports dietitian
-   High-fat or high-fiber meals before training
-   Skipping protein-rich foods post-exercise during growth phases
