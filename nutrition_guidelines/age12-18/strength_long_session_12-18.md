# Guidelines for Strength, Long Duration (45–90+ min), Age 12–18

## Overall Macro Targets for Entire Session

-   **Total Carbs:** 1.0–1.2 g/kg
-   **Total Protein:** 0.3–0.4 g/kg (mostly post-exercise)
-   **Total Fat:** ~0.2 g/kg (preferably after training)
-   **Total Electrolytes:**
    -   Sodium: 15–25 mg/kg if sweating heavily
    -   Potassium: 1–2 mg/kg (optional)
-   **Total Fluids:** 5–10 mL/kg every 15–20 min during training if sweating; monitor urine color

## Breakdown by Timing

### Pre-workout (30–60 min before)

-   **Carbs:** 0.5–0.8 g/kg (e.g., oatmeal, banana with honey, low-fiber toast)
-   **Protein:** 0.1–0.15 g/kg (e.g., Greek yogurt, milk, egg)
-   **Fat:** ≤0.1 g/kg (keep low to aid digestion)
-   **Fluids:** 5–7 mL/kg at least 1 hour prior

### During workout

-   **Carbs:** Optional, ~0.3–0.5 g/kg/hour if session >60 min or intense (e.g., diluted sports drink, banana slices)
-   **Protein:** Not usually needed, but 0.05–0.1 g/kg/hour can be helpful in long/high-volume sessions
-   **Hydration:** 150–250 mL every 15–20 min, based on sweat rate
-   **Electrolytes:** Add if session is in heat or high sweat loss (sodium ~15–25 mg/kg/hour)

### Post-workout (within 30 min)

-   **Carbs:** 0.8–1.0 g/kg (e.g., rice, smoothie, granola, fruit)
-   **Protein:** 0.25–0.3 g/kg (e.g., eggs, lean meat, chocolate milk, whey shake)
-   **Fat:** ~0.1–0.2 g/kg (e.g., avocado, nuts, olive oil if in a meal)
-   **Fluids:** ~1.25–1.5 L/kg body weight lost (typically 400–700 mL)

## Key Principles

-   Strength sessions longer than 45–60 min, especially with compound lifts or circuits, increase recovery needs.
-   Carbs + protein post-workout is critical for muscle repair, hormone support, and growth.
-   Adolescents have elevated protein synthesis windows, so post-training nutrition is especially impactful.
-   Emphasize whole foods with a mix of protein, carbs, and hydration — not just supplements.

## Avoid

-   High-fat or high-fiber meals right before training (can slow digestion)
-   Skipping recovery food (affects growth, recovery, and future performance)
-   Over-reliance on powders or supplements — whole foods are ideal
-   Energy drinks or high-caffeine products (unnecessary and potentially risky)
