# Guidelines for Cardio, Long Duration (90+ min), Age 12–18

## Overall Macro Targets for Entire Session

-   **Total Carbs:** 1.0–1.2 g/kg/hour
-   **Total Protein:** 0.25–0.3 g/kg
-   **Total Fat:** ~0.2 g/kg (mostly pre- and post-exercise)
-   **Total Electrolytes:**
    -   Sodium: 20–30 mg/kg/hour
    -   Potassium: 1–2 mg/kg/hour
    -   Magnesium: ~0.4–0.5 mg/kg/hour (if exercising in heat)
-   **Total Fluids:** ~5–10 mL/kg every 15–20 min, depending on sweat rate

## Breakdown by Timing

### Pre-workout (30–60 min before)

-   **Carbs:** 0.5–1.0 g/kg (e.g., sports drink, granola bar, banana)
-   **Protein:** ~0.1–0.15 g/kg (e.g., low-fat yogurt, milk, small smoothie)
-   **Fat:** <0.1 g/kg (limit fat to reduce stomach discomfort)
-   **Fluids:** 5–7 mL/kg at least 4 hrs prior; if needed, an extra 3–5 mL/kg 2 hrs prior

### During workout

-   **Carbs:** 0.8–1.0 g/kg/hour (sports drink, chews, diluted juice)
-   **Protein:** 0–0.1 g/kg/hour (optional if session exceeds 90–120 min)
-   **Electrolytes:**
    -   Sodium: 20–30 mg/kg/hour
    -   Potassium: ~1 mg/kg/hour
-   **Hydration:** 150–250 mL every 15–20 minutes

### Post-workout (within 30 min)

-   **Carbs:** 1.0–1.2 g/kg (fruit smoothie, rice bowl, chocolate milk)
-   **Protein:** 0.25–0.3 g/kg (to support muscle recovery and growth)
-   **Fat:** ~0.1–0.2 g/kg (optional; e.g., peanut butter, avocado)
-   **Fluids:** ~1.25–1.5 L per kg body weight lost during session

## Key Principles

-   **Energy Availability** is crucial during adolescence; skipping post-exercise nutrition can impair growth, recovery, and performance.
-   **Carbohydrates** should be the primary fuel, especially for high-intensity or long-duration efforts.
-   **Protein** supports both recovery and developmental needs (muscle growth, hormones).
-   **Hydration and electrolytes** are essential to avoid cramping, fatigue, and heat stress.
-   Encourage real foods when possible — flavored milk, fruit, and whole grains are effective for teens.

## Avoid During Long Cardio Sessions

-   High-fiber foods (can cause GI discomfort)
-   High-fat foods (slow digestion during training)
-   Energy drinks with high caffeine
-   Large solid meals immediately before or during exercise
-   Skipping recovery nutrition, especially if training daily
