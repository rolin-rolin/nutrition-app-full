# Guidelines for Strength, Short Duration (20–30 min), Age 6–11

## Overall Macro Targets for Entire Session

-   **Total Carbs:** ~0.3–0.5 g/kg
-   **Total Protein:** ~0.15–0.25 g/kg (mostly post-workout)
-   **Total Fat:** ~0.1–0.2 g/kg (from post-exercise food)
-   **Electrolytes:** Not a major concern unless in heat
-   **Total Fluids:** ~3–6 mL/kg before and after

## Breakdown by Timing

### Pre-workout (30–60 min before)

-   **Carbs:** ~0.3–0.5 g/kg (e.g., toast, fruit)
-   **Protein:** Optional (~0.05–0.1 g/kg)
-   **Fluids:** Water or diluted juice (~150–250 mL)

### During workout

-   **Carbs/Protein:** Not needed
-   **Hydration:** Small sips of water

### Post-workout (within 30 min)

-   **Carbs:** ~0.5 g/kg (fruit, crackers, milk)
-   **Protein:** ~0.15–0.2 g/kg (e.g., milk, cheese stick, eggs)
-   **Fluids:** ~300–500 mL

## Key Principles

-   Strength training in children is light/moderate; focus is on movement patterns.
-   Recovery protein is more relevant than intra-workout nutrition.
-   Whole food snacks like milk + crackers work great post-exercise.

## Avoid

-   Protein powders (not necessary)
-   High-sugar "energy" snacks
-   Forcing food if appetite is low post-workout
