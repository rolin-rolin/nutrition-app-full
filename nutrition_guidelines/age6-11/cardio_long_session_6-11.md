# Guidelines for Cardio, Long Duration (90+ min), Age 6–11

## Overall Macro Targets for Entire Session

-   **Total Carbs:** ~1.0 g/kg/hour (may vary by appetite and intensity)
-   **Total Protein:** ~0.2–0.25 g/kg (primarily post-exercise)
-   **Total Fat:** ~0.2 g/kg (limited during activity)
-   **Total Electrolytes:**
    -   Sodium: 10–20 mg/kg/hour
    -   Potassium: ~1 mg/kg/hour
    -   Magnesium: ~0.3–0.5 mg/kg/hour (optional if hot/sweaty conditions)
-   **Total Fluids:** ~3–6 mL/kg every 15–20 minutes

> Note: Children tend to regulate intake based on hunger/thirst more instinctively. Offering frequent, small, easily digestible options is preferred over strict numeric targets.

## Breakdown by Timing

### Pre-workout (30–60 min before)

-   **Carbs:** ~0.5–0.8 g/kg (e.g., half a banana, small granola bar, diluted juice)
-   **Protein:** ~0.05–0.1 g/kg (optional, e.g., milk or a yogurt pouch)
-   **Fat:** Minimal (<0.1 g/kg; avoid fatty snacks to reduce GI discomfort)
-   **Fluids:** 5 mL/kg about 1–2 hours before activity

### During workout

-   **Carbs:** 0.5–1.0 g/kg/hour (sports drink, small pieces of fruit, diluted juice)
-   **Protein:** Not necessary unless exercising >2 hrs; then up to ~0.1 g/kg/hour
-   **Electrolytes:**
    -   Sodium: 10–20 mg/kg/hour
    -   Potassium: ~1 mg/kg/hour
-   **Hydration:** Offer small sips (~100–150 mL) every 15–20 minutes
-   Make hydration and fueling feel like a break or fun — flavored drinks or squeezable fruit snacks work well.

### Post-workout (within 30 min)

-   **Carbs:** ~1.0 g/kg (fruit, chocolate milk, crackers with cheese)
-   **Protein:** ~0.2–0.25 g/kg (milk, yogurt, turkey slices)
-   **Fat:** ~0.1–0.2 g/kg (e.g., peanut butter, nuts if tolerated)
-   **Fluids:** ~1.25–1.5x body weight lost in sweat (roughly 300–500 mL for most)

## Key Principles

-   **Carbs First:** Kids rely more on carbs than adults for energy during exercise.
-   **Frequent Fueling:** Small, regular snacks or drinks are better tolerated than large meals.
-   **Hydration:** Children may not feel thirsty until they’re dehydrated. Encourage regular sips.
-   **Parental Supervision:** Ensure availability of age-appropriate, appealing options — avoid complex sports nutrition products unless supervised by a pediatric dietitian.
-   **Food Familiarity:** Stick with familiar foods to reduce risk of GI distress or refusal.

## Avoid During Long Cardio Sessions

-   High-fiber snacks (e.g., raw vegetables, bran cereals)
-   Fatty, fried foods (can slow digestion)
-   New or unfamiliar snacks
-   Caffeinated or carbonated drinks
-   Rigid schedules — be flexible and responsive to the child’s preferences and tolerance
