# Guidelines for Cardio, Short Duration (20–30 min), Age 6–11

## Overall Macro Targets for Entire Session

-   **Total Carbs:** ~0.3–0.5 g/kg
-   **Total Protein:** Not typically needed during activity
-   **Total Fat:** Minimal
-   **Total Electrolytes:**
    -   Sodium: ~10–15 mg/kg (if sweating)
    -   Potassium: Trace (~0.5–1 mg/kg if in heat)
-   **Total Fluids:** ~3–6 mL/kg before and after exercise

## Breakdown by Timing

### Pre-workout (30–60 min before)

-   **Carbs:** ~0.3–0.5 g/kg (e.g., fruit strip, half banana, small toast)
-   **Protein:** Optional, ~0.05–0.1 g/kg (e.g., milk, yogurt pouch)
-   **Fluids:** 5 mL/kg 1–2 hrs before

### During workout

-   **Carbs:** Not required unless high intensity
-   **Protein:** Not needed
-   **Hydration:** Sips of water every 15–20 min if desired

### Post-workout (within 30 min)

-   **Carbs:** ~0.5 g/kg (e.g., fruit, small juice box)
-   **Protein:** Optional if next session is soon (~0.1–0.15 g/kg)
-   **Fluids:** ~300–500 mL water or milk

## Key Principles

-   Kids doing <30 min of cardio rarely need structured nutrition.
-   Focus on hydration, gentle carbs, and light recovery snack.
-   If intensity is high (sprinting, intervals), include a small carb dose post-workout.

## Avoid

-   Sports drinks (unless high heat/intensity)
-   Large pre-workout meals
-   High-fiber or high-fat snacks before exercise
