# Guidelines for Cardio, Short Duration (20–30 min), Age 12–18

## Overall Macro Targets for Entire Session

-   **Total Carbs:** 0.5–0.7 g/kg
-   **Total Protein:** 0.1–0.2 g/kg (optional, mostly post-exercise)
-   **Total Fat:** Minimal (<0.1 g/kg)
-   **Total Electrolytes:**
    -   Sodium: ~15–20 mg/kg (only if sweating)
    -   Potassium: ~1 mg/kg
-   **Total Fluids:** ~5–7 mL/kg before and after

## Breakdown by Timing

### Pre-workout (30–60 min before)

-   **Carbs:** 0.3–0.5 g/kg (e.g., granola bar, small smoothie, banana)
-   **Protein:** Optional, ~0.05–0.1 g/kg (e.g., milk, protein-rich snack)
-   **Fluids:** 5 mL/kg 1–2 hrs before

### During workout

-   **Carbs/Protein:** Not required unless very high intensity
-   **Hydration:** Water sips (~100–200 mL every 20 min if desired)

### Post-workout (within 30 min)

-   **Carbs:** 0.5–0.7 g/kg (e.g., fruit, chocolate milk, crackers)
-   **Protein:** 0.15–0.2 g/kg (e.g., milk, yogurt, egg, lean protein)
-   **Fluids:** ~300–600 mL depending on sweat

## Key Principles

-   Nutritional support not strictly necessary for short cardio, but post-exercise fuel aids recovery especially for adolescents in growth phases.
-   Hydration and light carbs are sufficient for most short workouts.

## Avoid

-   High-fiber or high-fat snacks right before exercise
-   Energy drinks or excess caffeine
-   Skipping post-exercise food, especially during periods of growth or heavy training
